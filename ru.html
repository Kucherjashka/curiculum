        <h5>January 2022 — July 2023 : <a href="https://rubyruby.ru/">rubyruby.ru</a></h5>
        <p><b>Ruby on Rails developer</b><br></p>
        <p>It is a brilliant company with more then 30 active projects developed on the ruby-on-rails. E-commerce, job and vacation services. Promotion pages. Study hubs.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://secondfriendstore.ru/">secondfriendstore.ru</a></li>
            <p>This was my first project. I learned how to set up projects, work with RVM, and create isolated environments using LXD. I also studied the deployment system for both staging and production using Capistrano. I gained experience working with branches on the real project, including working with Git commands and participating in the code review process. Additionally, I assisted with adjusting the layout according to client requests and updating images.</p>
            <li><a href="http://esosp.ru/">esosp.com</a></li>
            <p>I was responsible for a range of tasks including layout and content updates, as well as a major project to add a new feature for "seller" users to create clients and link orders to them. This was made more challenging by the fact that the previous version of the application was written in 2016. My responsibilities included understanding client requirements, breaking down tasks, writing code and tests, and configuring deployment using Capistrano. Through this project, I was able to strengthen my skills in jQuery, gain a deeper understanding of AJAX, and learn about the principles of REACT. Now production is freezing because of huge changes and first version wasn't so successful. Actual stagings <a href="https://zap365.rubyruby.ru">zap365.rubyruby.ru</a>  & <a href="https://esosp.rubyruby.ru">esosp.rubyruby.ru</a> . Can give basic auth keys if neccesery </p>
            <li><a href="https://grintern.ru/">grintern.ru</a></li>
            <p>Payment system reintegration for new project owner, migrate existed customers to new schema, working with 3td party systems (etc. Walletone). Defend from ddos with cloudflare. Improve site security with custom validations. Changing some mailer configurations using postmarkapp & ActionMailer.</p>
            <li><a href="https://aksioma-vysota.ru/">aksioma-vysota.ru</a></li>
            <p>That project seems for first time that was built on Rails, but had a backend hidden under the hood using Node.js and a JS front end. Even trivial tasks could take a strange turn, such as having to find a specific record with large block of text wrapped in HTML markup in the database and modify  just to update a phone number on the site. Overall, this project exposed me to a wide range of challenges and experiences, and helped me to develop my problem-solving skills.</p>            
            <li>working with «<a href="https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec">Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec</a>» book by Aaron Sumner </li>
            <p>I was making <a href="https://github.com/1vid/rails-4-1-rspec-3-0/blob/01_untested/notes.md">notes</a> on my native language in my github account. It helps me improve my programming english and i hope my notes help beginner programmers who do not yet know English, but really want to develop their Rails skills</p>
